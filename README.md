# text_analysis_python

This is the code for the workshop "Automated text analysis" at the University of Amsterdam (21-22nd January '15).

It is tailored for beginners, so there are some bad practises that make the code easier to understand (some global variables, no Classes).

The notebook *summary_functions.ipynb* contains all the important stuff. The documentation is far from complete. 

Feel free to fork and improve it.


The folder *examples* have the notebooks used in the workshop:

Day 1:
- Introduction
- Scrapping_A
- Scrappint_B
- Visualization

Day 2:
- Sentiment
- LDA (Semantic)
- Classification
